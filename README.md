and a programmatic tool combined with Domain Specific Language geared towards common tasks related to obtaining, parsing, processing, computing, generating, analyzing and delivering observability metrics. This tool has been developed as computation and integration aide for a New Relic observability platform. What are the use cases for a TSAK ?

* Feel that New Relic provided Flex mechanism is inadequate for you custom integrations ?
* Need a testing tool for programmatic generation of the observability data ?
* Want to create a custom Prometheus scrubber that uses native New Relic data API ?
